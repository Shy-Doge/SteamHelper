<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was created in less than 1 hour so I could play games or emulators using Remote Play Together from Steam. Since adding the games as a Non-Steam Game doesn’t get the option to use Remote Play Together, I made this program that allows you to add as many games to it so you can use all Steam features with them.
I decided to share it since I might not be the only one that prefers Remote Play Together over any other program available.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

```sh
steam://install/480/
   ```
 2. Once installed, right click Spacewar on your library, Manage > Browse local files.

 3. Delete everything on it and paste the .exe from the <a href="https://github.com/Shy-Doge/SteamHelper/releases">Releases Page.</a>
